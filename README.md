*************************

The emulator is used to test _**QRadar**_ system for detecting in door attacks inside the orginization.
The attack are based on the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework.

1. Has a map of variety of network type attacks 
2. Can get a real gresp of the local network by comminicating with QRadar
3. Can create a simulation attack that originate inside the local network like a real world attack.
